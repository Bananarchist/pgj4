# REMAINS UNDONE
- Like, make it actually run a game
- Flesh out logic tests
- Come up with some improvements eg to game piece allocation that's a mess
- Figure out how to get logic compiling as WASM and remove logic from Elm (one truth source!)
	This very well could be what rips haskell out of this repo, prolly for Clojure
